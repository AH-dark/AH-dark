## Blog

**Welcome to my blog: [AHdark Blog](https://ahdark.blog)**

My blog runs on a WordPress deployment on Kubernetes, which is my own cluster. 
I am currently trying to learn how to maintain and develop cluster architecture through DevOps.

I use the infrastructure provided by Google Cloud Platform to set up and integrate cloud-native applications into the cluster. 
As a strong advocate of cloud-native architecture, I always choose large cloud service providers, even if they are more expensive.

In the near future, I plan to migrate the blog to Hugo and create the frontend pages myself.

## Work

1. I worked with RoundCloud from July 2020 to August 2021.
2. Since September 2021, I have been working as the Chief Architecture Officer at Ungine Times Tech.
3. Since August 2022, I have been working as the Technical Director at Scalar Investment Corp.
