## Blog

**Welcome to my blog: <https://ahdark.blog>**

My blog is running on a WordPress deployment on Kubernetes, which is my own cluster, and I'm trying to learn cluster maintenance and DevOps.

I use the infrastructure provided by Google Cloud Platform to set up a cluster and integrate its cloud-native applications into it. 
I am a staunch supporter of cloud native, I always choose the big cloud service providers, even though they are more expensive.

In the near future I may look to migrate the blog to Hugo and draw the blog's frontend pages myself.
